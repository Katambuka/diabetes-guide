  <h2>Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)</h2>
  <p>Modern CGMs like Dexcom G7 and Freestyle Libre 3 offer:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Real-time glucose readings every 1-5 minutes</li>
    <li>Trend arrows showing direction of change</li>
    <li>Alerts for highs and lows</li>
    <li>Integration with smartphones</li>
  </ul>
